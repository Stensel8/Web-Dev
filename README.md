# Web-Dev - Static Website Template – HTML, CSS & JavaScript

This project is a **template for a personal website**, built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. You can use this as a starting point to build your own static website — just add your own content, images, and styles.

This template was created from scratch and used by myself in the past. Since then, I've moved on to more **dynamic websites** using frameworks and databases. I'm keeping this repository **online and archived** so others can use it as a base for their own projects.

> The site that was originally based on this template has changed significantly over time.

## Contents

- `index.html` – Main page  
- `404.html` – Error page  
- `assets/img/` – Images and icons
